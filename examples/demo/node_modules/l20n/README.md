L20n reinvents software localization. Users should be able to benefit from the 
entire expressive power of a natural language.  L20n keeps simple things 
simple, and at the same time makes complex things possible.

L20n.js is a localization framework for websites which want to offer 
a best-in-class translation experience for their users.  L20n takes advantage 
of modern web technologies to offer a fast and lean localization of HTML and 
JavaScript.


How to use L20n
---------------

Include the following code in the `<head>` section of your HTML:

```html
<meta name="defaultLanguage" content="en-US">
<meta name="availableLanguages" content="de, en-US, fr, pl">
<link rel="localization" href="locales/myApp.{locale}.l20n">
<script defer src="dist/compat/web/l20n.js"></script>
```

L20n.js supports three kinds of translation resources:

 - L20n syntax, as documented at http://l20n.org/learn/,
 - properties syntax: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties (deprecated),
 - JSON files parsed by `tools/parse.js -o entries`.


What L20n's syntax looks like
-----------------------------

A straight-forward example in English:

```php
<brandName "Firefox">
<about "About {{ brandName }}">
<preferences "{{ brandName }} Preferences">
```

And the same thing in Polish:

```php
<brandName {
  nominative: "Firefox",
  genitive: "Firefoksa",
  dative: "Firefoksowi",
  accusative: "Firefoksa",
  instrumental: "Firefoksem",
  locative: "Firefoksie"
}>
<about "O {{ brandName.locative }}">
<preferences "Preferencje {{ brandName.genitive }}">
```

syntax.


Localizing Web content with HTML Bindings
------------------------------------------

You can take advantage of HTML bindings to localize your HTML documents with 
L20n.  See [docs/html][] for documentation and examples.

The JavaScript API and documentation
------------------------------------

It is also possible to use L20n programmatically, for instance in order to 
localize dynamic content.  Refer to [docs/node][] and [docs/view][] for more 
details.
